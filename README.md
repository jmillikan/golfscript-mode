Emacs mode for Golfscript

Not under development. Since Golfscript is almost never written in large files, this just provides some in-buffer interaction features. Golfscript must be in the path as the executable "golfscript.rb". It provides brace matching, including [ and ] even though they aren't technically matched but stack operators.
